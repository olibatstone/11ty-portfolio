## Summary
I redesigned the marketing website of a genetic testing service to support a pilot scale-up in November 2023. This boosted sign up rate by 5.3% compared to the pilot. I owned user research including usability testing, UX design, UI design and motion graphics design work.

## The need
We invited 3000 MassMutual policyholders to discover their genetic risk of common health conditions in 2022. 54% signed up. A survey showed the remainder needed additional assurances including on privacy, cost and the company behind the test. In preparation for a scale-up, we needed to meet these needs to maximise sign up rates and increase our customer value proposition.

## A new product identity
We also needed a product name and visual brand identity - I suggested Health Insights which was favoured in preference testing. On internal agreement, I led the creation of the visual identity in collaboration with my colleague. He created a circular motif to represent multiple polygenic risk scores in the abstract sense for use across touch points. I iterated on his concept to see whether it could also be modified to communicate the test more literally as a hero image.

One of our ideas was just to show a mock up of the report as the hero image. However, in usability testing I found that users were confused - it raised more questions, the kind that would be answered in consultation at the end of the service, not to mention concerns regarding information density in a small image.

## Who are the doctors?
We state that our test is created by world-leading Oxford professors. However, usability tests showed that users wanted a lot of detail on the medical authority we had - an interesting cultural difference between a UK and US audience.

## Why should I get this test?
One of the key factors for users when considering a test was accuracy. Usability testing showed they tried to compare our test with competitors, so I designed a chart using internal data on test performance. This provided an at-a-glance way to differentiate without having to delve into our science content.

## Impact
We launched the redesigned website at the end of 2023. We observed an increase in sign up rate of 5.3% in January 2024, indicating we met the needs of more users. The website, product name and visual identity received praise from US customers and led to greater interest from others.
