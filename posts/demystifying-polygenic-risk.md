## Summary
I redesigned the marketing website of our genetic testing service in November 2023, boosting sign up rate by 5.3%. I owned user research including usability testing, UX design, UI design and motion graphics design.

## The need
We invited 3000 MassMutual policyholders to discover their genetic risk of common health conditions in 2022. 54% signed up. A survey showed the remainder needed additional assurances on privacy, cost and the company behind the test. In preparation for a scale-up, we needed to meet these needs to maximise sign up rates and increase our customer value proposition.

## A new product identity
We also needed a product name and visual brand identity. I suggested Health Insights which was a winner in preference testing. I led the creation of the visual identity in collaboration with my colleague. He created a circular motif to represent multiple polygenic risk scores in the abstract sense for use across touch points. I iterated on his concept to see whether it could also be modified to communicate the test more literally as a hero image.

One of our ideas was just to show a mock up of the report as the hero image. However, in usability testing I found that users were confused - it raised more questions, the kind that would be answered in consultation at the end of the service, not to mention concerns regarding information density in a small image.

## Who are the doctors?
Usability tests also showed that users wanted deeper medical credentials.

Never mind that our test is created by world-leading Oxford professors - for a US audience, medical authority matters more in terms of building trust. An interesting cultural difference.

## Why should I get this test?
Usability tests also showed that users also wanted to compare our test with competitors. Research told us that one of the factors our demographic cared about the most was test accuracy. So I leveraged our internal data to design a chart as a simple way for users to differentiate our test between popular options without having to delve into our science.

## Impact
We launched the new website at the end of 2023. We observed an increase in sign up rate of 5.3% in January 2024, indicating we met the needs of more users. The website and visual identity received praise from US customers and led to greater interest from others.
