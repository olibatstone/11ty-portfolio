## Summary

We launched a garden membership gifting service, driving £32k revenue over Xmas 2021 and unblocking 13 gardens from partnering with us. Working with a product manager, four developers and a data scientist, I contributed all product, user research, UX and UI design work in 2021.

## The need

Gardens use gifting for back up cash to tide them over until spring. It was a must have feature for 13 of the 18 gardens we wanted to partner with. And a hundred support messages since Dec 2020 told us the customers of our primary client, the Newt, wanted to gift a membership too.

## It's nice to have something physical

I interviewed 5 people who'd gifted a digital membership in the last year, and 5 who'd received one. They told us they preferred physical gifts, in part out of concern for older people not being able to use digital ones, and because they're more meaningful.

The challenge was to convince a prospective gifter even the most elderly parent could receive and use it, design an experience where that was true, and create a digital gift that feels as meaningful as a physical one. I ran two team workshops to discuss this, talk technical needs and generate solution ideas to vote on.

## Digital and meaningful

We chose a multi-step flow asking gifters all we could to minimise work for receivers. We added a pre-start link to the receiving process so that a concerned gifter could check before entering the flow. To add emotional value, we supported personal messages and nicknames for v1.

## Impact

We launched in Nov 2021. Customers bought 505 gifts between Dec 2021 and Feb 2022. 92% of those added a personal message suggesting no need for an additional meaningful gift. And 8 out of 10 over 65 year olds who received a gift from younger groups in Mar 2022 rated it very easy in a survey.

## Learnings

Days after launch we noticed that 40% had sent it the same day rather than a specific date, so we added a send now feature. It was interesting to think about positioning the instant nature of it as a selling point - as a benefit over physical gifts and targeting last minute buyers.

## Next

One of our v2 solution ideas was to show the gifting process as an inline video or gif to aid discovery and engage passive visitors.
