description: Lead Product Designer
about: I'm a lead product designer with 9 years experience designing end-to-end web and mobile products in cross-functional teams. I use my expertise in user research, UX, UI, service design and design systems to deliver value fast and move ideas from 0-1. My stammer sharpens my focus on accessible, empathic and inclusive design. Most recently I worked on a genetic health service at Genomics where I raised account-creation rates to 59.3% (+5.3%) and cut kit rejections to 0.3% (-9.7%). I'm looking for contract or permanent opportunities to work on social-impact projects in health or environment sectors.
