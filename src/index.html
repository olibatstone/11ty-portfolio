description: Design lead
about: Iâ€™m a hands-on design leader who delivers value quickly through pragmatic UX, UI, and service design. I work end-to-end on social impact web and mobile products, most recently in health, often taking ideas from 0-1 in high-ambiguity environments. I share knowledge, mentor others, and keep learning to maximise client value. My stammer sharpens my focus on accessibility and empathy, leading to more inclusive, higher-quality design.
