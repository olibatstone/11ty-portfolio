## Summary

I redesigned the marketing site of Genomics’ genetic testing service as part of a scale-up. Account-creation rose from 54% in the pilot to 59.3% as of January 2024 since December 2023 launch, a gain of 5.3 percentage points. This increase broke healthcare norms, where account-creation rates are typically less than 40%.

## Problem

In late 2022, Genomics invited 3,000 MassMutual policyholders to discover their genetic risk of common health conditions as a free benefit. 54% created an account from the landing page. Surveys showed the rest had key concerns about:

- Lack of clarity about who was behind the test.
- Unclear value proposition.
- Worries over genetic data security.
- Fear of hidden costs despite the free benefit nature of the test.

Without resolving these pain points, the scale-up risked lower adoption and weaker customer buy-in.

## What I did

### Created a new product identity to build trust

- Genomics lacked a product identity, which undermined trust and adoption. I proposed and validated the name Health Insights through a naming survey, where it ranked top.
- After gaining approval, I analysed competitor visual systems to position us credibly in the market.
- To reduce engineering effort in a small team with other priorities, I developed the Genomics brand rather than rebuilding it; extending the dominant navy colour and introducing bold gradients to stand out from lighter-toned competitors.

### Met user needs with new supporting content

- I worked with executive and legal teams to design an About us page featuring founder and medical staff bios, published research, and media coverage.
- To address privacy concerns, I added a Trust and privacy page with explicit statements on non-sharing with third parties, GDPR and ISO27001 credentials, and how patients controlled their data.
- I created content that explained why insurers offered the test as a free benefit and assured that there are no hidden costs.

### Redesigned content to clarify the value proposition

- I added a sample report to the homepage hero as an easy way to show what patients would receive, adapting a pattern from other genetic services.
- The How it works section was buried on the home page. I promoted it in hierarchy, created a dedicated page and new content describing how we use patient genetic data to generate results and what patients could do with them.
- To simplify Science as much as possible, I worked with the science and medical teams to reduce jargon.

### Identified gaps with usability testing

I ran a moderated usability test with 5 participants from our target demographic (35-70, US, life insurance). The findings highlighted gaps:

- 2/5 said they would create an account.
- All were confused by the sample report - it raised more questions than answers, ones better suited to post-report consultations.
- Some struggled to see how our test was better than competitors.
- Some wanted more transparency on founders and medical staff.

### Iterated to resolve confusion and help decision-making

- To resolve sample report confusion, I explored alternatives that balanced detail with simplicity. I partnered with the Lead Product Designer (working on another project) on this and adopted his abstract representation that conveyed the essence of the test without overwhelming patients. I animated it using avatars to show how results vary between individuals, reflecting the polygenic (not one gene but many) nature of the test.
- To help patients evaluate the test, I looked at previous research on patient motivations and found that perceived test accuracy was a top factor in how many chose between tests. With this in mind, I created a comparison chart of competitor accuracy using newly published AUC (area under the curve) data from Genomic Prediction, 23andMe, and internal sources. The chart emphasised Health Insights’ stronger performance and guided patients to the Science page for a more detailed view.
- To meet patient requests for transparency, I expanded executive and medical professional bios to include where individuals studied, their history, and why they joined the company.

A follow‑up test revealed that patients saw the animation as a helpful augmentation in understanding what the test is, found the comparison chart useful, and often went to the Science page as a next step. The expanded bios also gave extra confidence, and 4/5 said they would create an account.

### Proactively reacted to market conditions

- 23andMe had a data breach in October 2023. To understand whether this was a threat to account-creation, I ran a quick pulse survey with 50 individuals in our target demographic. I explained the breach to participants, asked them to view a prototype of the marketing site and answer attitudinal questions.
- Awareness of the breach was low (18%).
- The majority indicated they would still create an account. While the survey size was small, I decided not to proactively modify the site content in the absence of an obvious threat.

- Account-creation rose to 59.3% as of January 2024 since launch in December 2023, a 5.3 percentage point increase from the pilot’s 54%.
- At least 3.2% of total account-creation came directly from Science, the largest of any other page, suggesting the new content gave more policyholders a better understanding of the test.
- The service outperformed healthcare benchmarks, where account-creation rates typically stayed below 40%.
- Genomics strengthened its customer value proposition.
