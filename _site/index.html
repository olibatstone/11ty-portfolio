        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a product design professional with a drive to push the limits of software and the teams that build it. I enjoy solving real problems for real people, creating high quality experiences, working end-to-end and talking about the value of design using actual numbers.</br></br>I love to learn and experiment - currently I'm using AI to synthesise research, ideate and test design solutions even faster. Besides design, I'm interested in nature and the universe, health, architecture, evolutionary biology, language and etymologies, cooking, veganism, and travel.</br></br>I've been designing experiences with users, business leaders, designers and engineers for 9 years. I've worked in startups and larger companies across a wide range of sectors serving millions of users. See my CV for more details.
