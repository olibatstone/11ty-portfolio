        <h1>Unlocking UK market with Bupa</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I designed a clinician-driven version of our US Health Insights service to allow us to partner with our client Bupa and launch in the UK.</p>
<h2>The need</h2>
<p>Our client Bupa wanted a service they could include as part of their health assessment. So we needed to modify our US service to make it clinician driven.</p>
<h2>MHRA approval</h2>
<p>I interviewed GPs to ensure test safety and was successful in achieving MHRA approval.</p>
