        <h1>Gifting garden memberships</h1>
    </header>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We launched a garden membership gifting service, driving £32k revenue over Xmas 2021 and unblocking 13 gardens from partnering with us. Working with a product manager, four developers and a data scientist, I contributed all product, user research, UX and UI design work in 2021.</p>
<h2>The need</h2>
<p>Gardens use gifting for back up cash to tide them over until spring. It was a must have feature for 13 of the 18 gardens we wanted to partner with. And a hundred support messages since Dec 2020 told us the customers of our primary client, the Newt, wanted to gift a membership too.</p>
<h2>It's nice to have something physical</h2>
<p>I interviewed 5 people who'd gifted a digital membership in the last year, and 5 who'd received one. They told us they preferred physical gifts, in part out of concern for older people not being able to use digital ones, and because they're more meaningful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's nice to have something physical to give somebody - my dad is pretty good, but my mum isn't technologically minded. — Sarah, 49</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The challenge was to convince a prospective gifter even the most elderly parent could receive and use it, design an experience where that was true, and create a digital gift that feels as meaningful as a physical one. I ran two team workshops to discuss this, talk technical needs and generate solution ideas to vote on.</p>

<h2>Digital and meaningful</h2>
<p>We chose a multi-step flow asking gifters all we could to minimise work for receivers. We added a pre-start link to the receiving process so that a concerned gifter could check before entering the flow. To add emotional value, we supported personal messages and nicknames for v1.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>We launched in Nov 2021. Customers bought 505 gifts between Dec 2021 and Feb 2022. 92% of those added a personal message suggesting no need for an additional meaningful gift. And 8 out of 10 over 65 year olds who received a gift from younger groups in Mar 2022 rated it very easy in a survey.</p>
<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>Days after launch we noticed that 40% had sent it the same day rather than a specific date, so we added a send now feature. It was interesting to think about positioning the instant nature of it as a selling point - as a benefit over physical gifts and targeting last minute buyers.</p>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>One of our v2 solution ideas was to show the gifting process as an inline video or gif to aid discovery and engage passive visitors.</p>
