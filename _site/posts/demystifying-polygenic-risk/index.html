        <h1>Demystifying polygenic risk</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I redesigned the marketing website of a genetic testing service to support a pilot scale-up in November 2023. This boosted sign up rate by 5.3% compared to the pilot. I owned user research including usability testing, UX design, UI design and motion graphics design work.</p>
<h2>The need</h2>
<p>We invited 3000 MassMutual policyholders to discover their genetic risk of common health conditions as a free benefit in 2022. 54% signed up. A survey showed the remainder needed additional assurances including on privacy, hidden costs and the company behind the test. In preparation for a scale-up, we needed to meet these needs to maximise sign up rates and increase our customer value proposition.</p>
<h2>A new product identity</h2>
<p>We also needed a product name and visual brand identity - I suggested Health Insights which was favoured in preference testing. On internal agreement, I led the creation of the visual identity in collaboration with my colleague. He created a circular motif to represent multiple polygenic risk scores in the abstract sense for use across touch points. I iterated on his concept to see whether it could also be modified to communicate the test more literally as a hero image.</p>

<p>One of our ideas was just to show a mock up of the report as the hero image. However, in usability testing I found that users were confused - it raised more questions, the kind that would be answered in consultation at the end of the service, not to mention concerns regarding information density in a small image.</p>
<h2>Who are the doctors?</h2>
<p>We state that our test is created by world-leading Oxford professors. However, usability tests showed that users wanted a lot of detail on the medical authority we had - an interesting cultural difference between a UK and US audience.</p>

<h2>Why should I get this test?</h2>
<p>One of the key factors for users when considering a test was accuracy. Usability testing showed they tried to compare our test with competitors, so I designed a chart using internal data on test performance. This provided an at-a-glance way to differentiate without having to delve into our science content.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>We launched the redesigned website at the end of 2023. We observed an increase in sign up rate of 5.3% in January 2024, indicating we met the needs of more users. The website, product name and visual identity received praise from US customers and led to greater interest from others.</p>
