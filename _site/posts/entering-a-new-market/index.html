<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I designed a new version of the sign-up process for our genetic testing service to enter the UK market in July 2024. This led to the successful entry in July 2025. I contributed all user research including usability testing, UX design and UI design work.</p>
<h2>The need</h2>
<p>Bupa in the UK wanted to provide our polygenic risk scores to their patients as part of a clinician-led model. As our existing US-based service is patient-led, I needed to design a new joining experience to support this new model for Bupa and other UK clinics.</p>
<p>Design it in a way that supports dynamic branding capabilities? Modular approach?</p>
<p>Brandable journeys done in a whitelabel way</p>
<h2>Introducing the service</h2>
<p>Our US service has a marketing site. It explains the value proposition and provides answers to patient questions regarding the nature of the test, scientific accuracy, data security policies and more.</p>
<p>However, in this clinician-led model, patients first interact with the service via an invitation email from the clinic. Due to competing demands for engineering time, we needed to meet those needs in the email and following sign-up steps, as opposed to creating a new marketing website.</p>

<h2>Information transparency</h2>
<p>In our US service, patients enter the multi-step sign-up flow from the marketing site, where they provide personal details such as age and sex at birth. We explain why we ask for these details and how we use them directly under each question.</p>
<p>Image of existing flow that I played a role in designing</p>
<p>At the end of the flow we use a GDS-inspired confirmation page where patients can see all they’ve entered and modify it if desired. In the clinician-led version, we considered using this page to explain how we have this information and what we will use it for.</p>

<h2>Address look-up</h2>
<p>Bupa needed to still confirm shipping address because while they had information, it could have been out of date, and we didn’t have an API that would allow us to update a patient’s address live.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>Well Life
We launched the redesigned website at the end of 2023. We observed an increase in sign-up rate of 5.3% in January 2024, indicating we met the needs of more users. The website, product name and visual identity received praise from US customers and led to greater interest from others.</p>
