<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I designed a new version of Health Insights, a US genetic testing service, to support a UK clinician-led experience in July 2024. This led to the successful launch in July 2025 with Genomics’ first UK client, Bupa, and the start of a UK rollout. I contributed all design work including user research, usability testing, UX design and UI design.</p>
<h2>The need</h2>
<p>Bupa UK wanted to provide Health Insights to their patients as part of a clinician-led model. As our existing US-based service is patient-led, we needed to define a new joining experience. This new approach would meet Bupa’s needs but also other UK clinics who were interested. Bupa also wanted to brand the journey so that patients knew it was a Bupa supported service.</p>
<h2>Introducing the service</h2>
<p>Our US service has a marketing site. It explains the value proposition and provides answers to patient questions regarding the nature of the test, scientific accuracy, data security policies and more. In the clinician-led model, patients first interact with the service via an invitation email from the clinic. Due to competing demands for engineering time, we needed to meet those needs in the email and following sign-up steps, as opposed to creating a new marketing website.</p>
<h2>Information transparency</h2>
<p>In our US service, patients enter the multi-step sign-up flow from the marketing site, where they provide personal details such as age and sex at birth. We explain why we ask for these details and how we use them directly under each question. At the end of the flow we use a GDS-inspired confirmation page where patients can see all they’ve entered and modify if desired.</p>
<p><img src="/images/supporting-clinician-led-care/6.png" alt="4 mobile screens with a question on each; what is your date of birth, what sex were you assigned at birth, which of these best describe your race of ethnicity, and what is your phone number."> <figcaption>Part of the US-based existing flow I helped design</figcaption></p>
<p>For the clinician-led UK model, Bupa provides us with a list of patient data before they send an invite email to each. We repurposed the confirmation page to reassure patients about the information we would already hold and how it will be used, enhancing transparency and trust.</p>

<h2>Address look-up</h2>
<p>Although Bupa supplied patient data, shipping addresses might be outdated. To verify and update addresses efficiently, we integrated SmartyStreets, a reliable address lookup service, ensuring accurate delivery.</p>

<h2>Supporting co-branding</h2>
<p>To meet the branding preferences of Bupa and future UK clients, I developed flexible design components that allow easy customisation and maintenance of co-branded screens without extensive engineering overhead.</p>

<h2>Final designs</h2>
<p>I designed a practical, adaptable solution balancing user needs with engineering constraints. This resulted in a flexible codebase that supports scalable co-branding and smooth patient flows.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>We launched successfully in July 2025 with Bupa, receiving positive patient feedback. The clinician-led experience has since been rolled out to additional UK clients, starting with Well Life.</p>
