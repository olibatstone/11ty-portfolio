        <h1>Tuning the test kit</h1>
    </header>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We defined a new test kit experience for our genetic testing service Health Insights. This increased successful kit use by 4.7% as of Jan 2024 since launch in Nov 2023 compared to our initial pilot service. Ideating with a product owner, a product designer and two developers, I contributed and owned product, user research, UX, UI and packaging design work in 2023.</p>
<h2>Mistaken identity</h2>
<p>The pilot of our genetic testing service showed that 10% of 1367 test kits returned to the lab were invalid. 5% were unidentifiable - no written date of birth - and 5% had unusable or missing saliva samples. This meant the lab couldn't return test results to those participants and had to order them a new kit. It would take weeks to arrive.</p>
<h2>A new way to separate saliva</h2>
<p>Working with developers, supply and lab teams, we found a new way for the lab to identify test kits instead of date of birth. For every test kit sent to users, we'd generate a unique code and print a copy on the tube inside. Before adding a sample, users would confirm their identity by entering the code into our website. If it matched the corresponding code in our database, we'd show instructions for giving a sample.</p>
